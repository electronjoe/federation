# 3. API Structure

The Federation API is built on top of the gRPC framework, leveraging Protocol Buffers for efficient and structured data exchange. This section provides an overview of the API's structure, including its protocol, data models, and message types.

## 3.1 Protocol Overview

The Federation API uses gRPC, a modern open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. gRPC is based on the HTTP/2 protocol and uses Protocol Buffers for data serialization, enabling efficient and high-performance communication between clients and servers.

Key aspects of the gRPC protocol in the Federation API:

- **Streaming RPCs**: In addition to traditional unary RPCs, the API makes extensive use of streaming RPCs, which allow for long-lived, bidirectional data streams between clients and servers. This is particularly useful for scenarios involving continuous updates or real-time monitoring.

- **Protocol Buffers**: Data structures in the API are defined using Protocol Buffer message types, which provide a compact and efficient binary serialization format. This helps reduce network overhead and improve performance.

- **Service Definition**: The API's functionality is defined in a `.proto` file, which specifies the available services, methods, and message types. This file serves as the contract between clients and servers, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

## 3.2 Data Models

The Federation API defines several key data models that represent the core entities involved in federated network operations. These data models are defined as Protocol Buffer messages and are used throughout the API's methods and responses.

Some of the primary data models include:

- `InterconnectionPoint`: Represents a physical or logical interface where networks can interconnect.
- `ServiceOption`: Encapsulates the details of a potential service offering from a Provider.
- `Service`: Represents an active, provisioned service between a Requestor and Provider.
- `NetworkInterface`: Defines the characteristics of a network interface associated with an Interconnection Point.

These data models are designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new fields or nested messages as the API evolves to support more advanced features or use cases.

## 3.3 Message Types

The Federation API defines several message types that are used for requests, responses, and data exchange between clients and servers. These message types are defined in the `.proto` file and are based on the core data models mentioned above.

Some key message types include:

- Request messages (e.g., `StreamInterconnectionPointsRequest`, `ScheduleServiceRequest`)
- Response messages (e.g., `StreamInterconnectionPointsResponse`, `ScheduleServiceResponse`)
- Update messages (e.g., `MonitorServicesResponse`, `ServiceStatus`)

These message types often contain common fields, such as identifiers, timestamps, and metadata, to facilitate consistent handling and processing across different API methods.

By understanding the API's structure, including its protocol, data models, and message types, you'll be better equipped to develop robust and efficient applications that leverage the full capabilities of the Federation API.

In the next section, we'll dive into authentication and security considerations, ensuring that your interactions with the API are secure and compliant with industry best practices.

# 4. Authentication and Security

Ensuring the security and integrity of data exchanged through the Federation API is of paramount importance. This section covers the authentication and security mechanisms employed by the API, providing guidance on how to securely access and use its functionality.

## 4.1 Authentication Methods

The Federation API supports several industry-standard authentication methods to verify the identity of clients and servers. The primary authentication mechanisms supported are:

1. **OAuth 2.0**: The API leverages the OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure, token-based authentication. Clients can obtain access tokens from an authorized identity provider and include them in API requests for authentication.

2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The API supports JWT-based authentication, allowing clients to include signed JWT tokens in requests for verification.

3. **API Keys**: For simpler use cases or testing environments, the API also supports the use of static API keys for authentication. API keys should be securely managed and rotated regularly.

The choice of authentication method depends on the specific requirements and security considerations of your application. OAuth 2.0 and JWT are recommended for production environments, as they provide more robust and flexible authentication mechanisms.

## 4.2 Authorization

Provider implementations of the Federation Server may implement role-based access control ([RBAC](GLOSSARY.md#other-terms)) for authorization. RBAC ensures that authenticated clients can only access and perform operations that they are explicitly authorized for, based on their assigned roles and permissions.  Authorization could be accomplished by the Provider's gRPC interceptor after Authentication, using access to authorization policies and role assignments made accessible by provider infrastructure.

## 4.3 Data Protection

In addition to authentication and authorization, the Federation API employs various data protection measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data:

1. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: All communication between clients and servers is encrypted using TLS, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. The API enforces the use of strong encryption ciphers and supports modern TLS versions.

2. **Sensitive Data Handling**: The API follows best practices for handling and transmitting sensitive data, such as encryption keys, credentials, and other confidential information. Sensitive data is never transmitted in plaintext and is securely stored and managed.

By leveraging industry-standard authentication methods, implementing robust authorization mechanisms, and employing strong data protection measures, the Federation API provides a secure and trusted platform for federated network operations.

In the next section, we'll dive into the core resources and data models that form the foundation of the API, including detailed explanations of the `InterconnectionPoint`, `ServiceOption`, `Service`, and `NetworkInterface` entities.

# 5. Core Resources

The Federation API revolves around several core resources that represent the fundamental entities involved in federated network operations. These resources are defined as Protocol Buffer messages and are used extensively throughout the API's methods and responses. In this section, we'll explore the structure and usage of these key resources.

## 5.1 InterconnectionPoint

The `InterconnectionPoint` message is a central component of the Federation API, representing the physical or logical interfaces where different networks can interconnect and exchange traffic. It encapsulates a wealth of information about the interconnection point, including its unique identifier, capabilities, location, and availability.

Key fields in the `InterconnectionPoint` message:

- `uuid`: A globally unique identifier for the interconnection point.
- `transceiver_model` or `bent_pipe_payload`: Details about the transceiver or bent-pipe payload used at this interconnection point.
- `coordinates`: Information about the location and motion of the interconnection point over time.
- `ip_network` and `ethernet_address`: Network addressing details for the interconnection point.
- `rx_mode`: The receive mode of the interface (promiscuous or non-promiscuous).
- `local_ids`: Optional local identifiers for the interface within the platform or switch.
- `max_data_rate_bps`: The maximum data rate supported by the interconnection point.
- `power_budgets`: Constraints on the available signal power for wireless interconnection points.

The `InterconnectionPoint` message is used extensively throughout the API, serving as a building block for other resources like `ServiceOption` and `Service`. Providers advertise their available interconnection points, and Requestors use this information to evaluate potential services and make informed decisions.

## 5.2 ServiceOption

The `ServiceOption` message represents a potential service offering from a Provider. It encapsulates the details of a possible network service, allowing Requestors to evaluate and select the most suitable options for their needs.

Key fields in the `ServiceOption` message:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the service option.
- `x_requestor_interconnection` and `y_requestor_interconnection`: The interconnection points on the Requestor's side involved in this service option.
- `x_provider_interconnection` and `y_provider_interconnection`: The interconnection points on the Provider's side involved in this service option.
- `ip_network`: If applicable, the IP network or prefix that the service option provides connectivity to.
- `directionality`: The directionality of the service (bidirectional, Requestor-to-Provider, or Provider-to-Requestor).
- `service_attributes_x_to_y` and `service_attributes_y_to_x`: Temporal service attributes like bandwidth, latency, and availability for each direction.

Providers generate and advertise `ServiceOption` messages based on their current network state, available resources, and policies. Requestors can retrieve and analyze these service options, filtering and sorting them based on their specific requirements.

## 5.3 Service

The `Service` message represents an active, provisioned service between a Requestor and a Provider. It encapsulates the details of the agreed-upon service, including the interconnection points involved, service attributes, and status information.

Key fields in the `Service` message:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the service, assigned by the Provider.
- `x_service_endpoint` and `y_service_endpoint`: The interconnection points involved in the service.
- `planned_service_attributes_x_to_y` and `planned_service_attributes_y_to_x`: The planned service attributes for each direction, as agreed upon during service provisioning.
- `reported_service_attributes_x_to_y` and `reported_service_attributes_y_to_x`: The actual service attributes reported by the Requestor or Provider, which may differ from the planned attributes.
- `is_active`: A flag indicating whether the service is currently active and provisioned.

The `Service` message is used for monitoring and managing the lifecycle of a provisioned service. Requestors can receive updates about the service's status, attributes, and any changes or termination notifications from the Provider.

## 5.4 NetworkInterface

The `NetworkInterface` message defines the characteristics of a network interface associated with an `InterconnectionPoint`. It provides additional details about the interface, such as its addressing information, data rate capabilities, and local identifiers within the platform or switch.

Key fields in the `NetworkInterface` message:

- `interface_id`: A unique identifier for the network interface.
- `wired` or `wireless`: Details about the interface type (wired or wireless) and associated properties.
- `ip_network`: The IP network or prefix associated with the interface.
- `ethernet_address`: The Ethernet (MAC) address of the interface.
- `rx_mode`: The receive mode of the interface (promiscuous or non-promiscuous).
- `local_ids`: Optional local identifiers for the interface within the platform or switch.
- `max_data_rate_bps`: The maximum data rate supported by the interface.

The `NetworkInterface` message is typically nested within the `InterconnectionPoint` message, providing additional context and details about the specific interface involved in the interconnection.

By understanding the structure and usage of these core resources, you'll be better equipped to work with the Federation API, interpret the data exchanged, and develop applications that leverage the full capabilities of federated network operations.

In the next section, we'll explore the request and response formats used by the API, including details on Protocol Buffers, common fields, and temporal considerations.

# 6. Request/Response Formats

Understanding the structure and format of requests and responses is crucial for effectively working with the Federation API. This section delves into the use of Protocol Buffers, common fields across different message types, and important temporal considerations.

## 6.1 Protocol Buffers

The Federation API uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its data serialization format. Protocol Buffers offer several advantages over other formats like JSON or XML:

- **Efficiency**: Protobuf serializes data into a compact binary format, reducing payload size and improving transmission speed.
- **Strong Typing**: Protobuf messages are strongly typed, which helps catch errors at compile-time and improves code reliability.
- **Language Agnostic**: Protobuf supports multiple programming languages, allowing for easy integration across different platforms and environments.
- **Versioning Support**: Protobuf has built-in support for backwards-compatible schema evolution, making it easier to update message definitions over time.

Key points for working with Protocol Buffers in the Federation API:

- Message definitions are specified in `.proto` files, which serve as the contract between clients and servers.
- Clients and servers use generated code from these `.proto` files to serialize and deserialize data.
- Fields in protobuf messages are identified by unique numbers, allowing for backwards-compatible additions and changes.

Example of a protobuf message definition from the Federation API:

```protobuf
message InterconnectionPoint {
  string uuid = 1;
  oneof type {
    TransceiverModel transceiver_model = 2;
    BentPipePayload bent_pipe_payload = 3;
  }
  Motion coordinates = 4;
  IPNetwork ip_network = 5;
  string ethernet_address = 6;
  Mode rx_mode = 7;
  repeated LocalId local_ids = 8;
  double max_data_rate_bps = 9;
  repeated SignalPowerBudget power_budgets = 10;
}
```

## 6.2 Common Fields

Many message types in the Federation API share common fields to ensure consistency and provide essential metadata. Understanding these common fields is crucial for effective API usage.

Some of the most frequently encountered common fields include:

1. **Identifiers**:
   - `uuid`: A globally unique identifier for resources like InterconnectionPoints.
   - `id`: A unique identifier within a specific context, such as for ServiceOptions or Services.

2. **Timestamps**:
   - `create_time`: The time when a resource was created.
   - `update_time`: The last time a resource was updated.

3. **Versioning**:
   - `etag`: An opaque token representing the current version of a resource, used for optimistic concurrency control.

4. **Metadata**:
   - `labels`: Key-value pairs for attaching metadata to resources.
   - `annotations`: Additional metadata that can be used for various purposes.

5. **Pagination**:
   - `page_size`: The maximum number of items to return in a paginated response.
   - `page_token`: A token for retrieving the next page of results.

Example of common fields in a response message:

```protobuf
message ListServiceOptionsResponse {
  repeated ServiceOption service_options = 1;
  string next_page_token = 2;
}
```

## 6.3 Temporal Considerations

The Federation API deals with dynamic network environments where resource availability and characteristics can change rapidly over time. To address this, many messages in the API incorporate temporal elements.

Key temporal considerations in the Federation API:

1. **Time Intervals**:
   - Many resources and attributes are associated with specific time intervals, represented by the `google.type.Interval` message.
   - Time intervals allow for scheduling of services, representation of resource availability windows, and specification of time-bound attributes.

2. **Temporal Attributes**:
   - Service attributes like bandwidth, latency, and availability are often represented as temporal values, changing over time.
   - The `TemporalServiceAttributes` message is used to represent these time-varying characteristics.

3. **Motion and Coordinates**:
   - For mobile assets like satellites, the `Motion` message represents time-dynamic location information.
   - This allows for accurate prediction of asset positions and link characteristics over time.

4. **Streaming Updates**:
   - Many API methods use streaming RPCs to provide real-time updates as network conditions change.
   - Clients should be prepared to handle and process these temporal updates efficiently.

Example of temporal considerations in a message:

```protobuf
message ServiceOption {
  // ... other fields ...
  TemporalServiceAttributes service_attributes_x_to_y = 8;
  TemporalServiceAttributes service_attributes_y_to_x = 9;
}

message TemporalServiceAttributes {
  google.type.Interval time_interval = 1;
  // ... other attribute fields ...
}
```

Best practices for handling temporal data:

- Always consider the time context when interpreting resource information or service attributes.
- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for managing time-series data on the client side.
- Use appropriate time zones (preferably UTC) consistently across all temporal data.
- Be prepared to handle updates and changes to temporal data through streaming API methods.

By understanding and properly handling these request/response formats, including Protocol Buffers, common fields, and temporal considerations, you'll be well-equipped to build robust and efficient applications that leverage the full capabilities of the Federation API.

In the next section, we'll explore the specific endpoints and methods provided by the API, detailing their purposes, request/response structures, and usage patterns.

By understanding and effectively utilizing these endpoints and methods, you can build robust applications that leverage the full capabilities of the Federation API for managing federated network services. Remember to consult the API reference documentation for detailed information on request and response message structures, as well as any additional methods that may be available.

In the next section, we'll explore error handling strategies to ensure your applications can gracefully manage various error conditions that may arise when using the Federation API.

# 8. Error Handling

Effective error handling is crucial when working with the Federation API to ensure robust and reliable applications. This section covers common error codes, error messages, and retry strategies to help you build resilient systems that can gracefully handle various failure scenarios.

## 8.1 Error Codes

The Federation API uses standard gRPC status codes to indicate the result of API calls. Understanding these codes is essential for implementing proper error handling in your applications.

Common error codes you may encounter include:

- `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (3): The request contains invalid parameters or data.
- `NOT_FOUND` (5): The requested resource does not exist.
- `ALREADY_EXISTS` (6): An attempt to create a resource that already exists.
- `PERMISSION_DENIED` (7): The client lacks necessary permissions for the operation.
- `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (8): Quota or rate limit exceeded.
- `FAILED_PRECONDITION` (9): The system is not in a state required for the operation.
- `ABORTED` (10): The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue.
- `UNAVAILABLE` (14): The service is currently unavailable, often due to temporary issues.
- `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` (4): The operation didn't complete within the specified timeout.

Here's an example of how to handle gRPC errors in Golang:

```go
import (
    "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
)

func handleError(err error) {
    if err == nil {
        return
    }

    st, ok := status.FromError(err)
    if !ok {
        // This is not a gRPC error, handle accordingly
        log.Printf("Non-gRPC error: %v", err)
        return
    }

    switch st.Code() {
    case codes.InvalidArgument:
        log.Printf("Invalid argument: %v", st.Message())
    case codes.NotFound:
        log.Printf("Resource not found: %v", st.Message())
    case codes.PermissionDenied:
        log.Printf("Permission denied: %v", st.Message())
    case codes.ResourceExhausted:
        log.Printf("Resource exhausted: %v", st.Message())
    case codes.Unavailable:
        log.Printf("Service unavailable: %v", st.Message())
    default:
        log.Printf("Unexpected error: %v", st.Message())
    }
}
```

## 8.2 Error Messages

Error messages provide additional context about the nature of the error. The Federation API strives to provide clear and informative error messages to aid in troubleshooting and error resolution.

When handling errors, it's important to:

1. Log the full error message for debugging purposes.
2. Extract relevant information to present to end-users or for automated error handling.
3. Use error details to guide retry strategies or fallback mechanisms.

Here's an example of extracting and logging error details in Golang:

```go
import (
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
    "google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc/errdetails"
)

func logErrorDetails(err error) {
    st, ok := status.FromError(err)
    if !ok {
        log.Printf("Non-gRPC error: %v", err)
        return
    }

    log.Printf("Error Code: %s", st.Code())
    log.Printf("Error Message: %s", st.Message())

    for _, detail := range st.Details() {
        switch t := detail.(type) {
        case *errdetails.BadRequest:
            for _, violation := range t.GetFieldViolations() {
                log.Printf("Bad Request: Field: %s, Description: %s", violation.GetField(), violation.GetDescription())
            }
        case *errdetails.QuotaFailure:
            for _, violation := range t.GetViolations() {
                log.Printf("Quota Failure: Subject: %s, Description: %s", violation.GetSubject(), violation.GetDescription())
            }
        case *errdetails.RetryInfo:
            log.Printf("Retry Info: Retry Delay: %v", t.GetRetryDelay().AsDuration())
        }
    }
}
```

## 8.3 Retry Strategies

Implementing effective retry strategies is crucial for handling transient errors and building resilient applications. The Federation API supports configurable retry policies using gRPC's built-in retry mechanism.

Here's an example of how to implement a retry strategy with exponential backoff in Golang:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "google.golang.org/grpc"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
    "time"
    "math/rand"
)

func retryWithExponentialBackoff(ctx context.Context, f func() error) error {
    maxRetries := 5
    baseDelay := 100 * time.Millisecond
    maxDelay := 5 * time.Second
    factor := 2.0
    jitter := 0.2

    for attempt := 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++ {
        err := f()
        if err == nil {
            return nil
        }

        st, ok := status.FromError(err)
        if !ok || (st.Code() != codes.Unavailable && st.Code() != codes.DeadlineExceeded) {
            return err
        }

        delay := float64(baseDelay) * math.Pow(factor, float64(attempt))
        delay = math.Min(float64(maxDelay), delay * (1 + jitter*(rand.Float64()*2-1)))

        timer := time.NewTimer(time.Duration(delay))
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            timer.Stop()
            return ctx.Err()
        case <-timer.C:
            // Continue with the next iteration
        }
    }

    return status.Error(codes.DeadlineExceeded, "max retries exceeded")
}

// Example usage
func callFederationAPI(ctx context.Context, client FederationClient) error {
    return retryWithExponentialBackoff(ctx, func() error {
        _, err := client.SomeAPIMethod(ctx, &SomeRequest{})
        return err
    })
}
```

This implementation includes:

1. Configurable maximum retries, base delay, maximum delay, and backoff factor.
2. Jitter to avoid synchronized retries from multiple clients.
3. Checks for specific retryable error codes (Unavailable and DeadlineExceeded).
4. Respect for context cancellation to allow for overall timeout control.

For more complex scenarios, you can use the gRPC retry interceptor, which allows for more fine-grained control over retry behavior. Here's an example of how to set up a gRPC client with retry and backoff configuration:

```go
import (
    "google.golang.org/grpc"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/backoff"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    backoffConfig := backoff.Config{
        BaseDelay:  100 * time.Millisecond,
        Multiplier: 2.0,
        Jitter:     0.2,
        MaxDelay:   5 * time.Second,
    }

    conn, err := grpc.Dial(
        "federation.api.address:port",
        grpc.WithInsecure(),
        grpc.WithConnectParams(grpc.ConnectParams{
            Backoff: backoffConfig,
            MinConnectTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        }),
        grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{
            "methodConfig": [{
                "name": [{"service": "federation.FederationService"}],
                "retryPolicy": {
                    "MaxAttempts": 5,
                    "InitialBackoff": "0.1s",
                    "MaxBackoff": "5s",
                    "BackoffMultiplier": 2,
                    "RetryableStatusCodes": ["UNAVAILABLE", "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED"]
                }
            }]
        }`),
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect: %v", err)
    }
    defer conn.Close()

    // Create your Federation API client and make calls
    client := NewFederationClient(conn)
    // Use the client...
}
```

This configuration sets up automatic retries for all methods of the FederationService, with exponential backoff and jitter. It will retry on UNAVAILABLE and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors, up to a maximum of 5 attempts.

By implementing these error handling and retry strategies, you can build robust applications that gracefully handle various error conditions when interacting with the Federation API. Remember to test your error handling thoroughly and adjust retry parameters based on your specific use case and the characteristics of your network environment.

# 9. Rate Limiting and Quotas

In the Federation API ecosystem, rate limiting and quota management are crucial for ensuring fair usage, preventing abuse, and maintaining the overall health and performance of the system. It's important to note that the implementation of rate limiting and quota enforcement is the responsibility of the Provider's Federation Service implementation. This section will explore how these mechanisms work, their importance, and how they might be implemented by Providers.

## 9.1 Request Limits

Request limits are restrictions on the number of API calls a client can make within a specified time period. These limits help prevent any single client from overwhelming the system or degrading service quality for others.

Key points about request limits in the Federation API:

- **Provider Responsibility**: Each Provider is responsible for implementing and enforcing their own request limits based on their infrastructure capabilities and business requirements.

- **Method-Specific Limits**: Different API methods may have different rate limits. For example, streaming methods like `StreamInterconnectionPoints` might have different limits compared to unary calls like `ScheduleService`.

- **Client Identification**: Providers typically use API keys or OAuth tokens to identify clients and apply rate limits on a per-client basis.

Implementation example using a gRPC interceptor in Go:

```go
import (
    "golang.org/x/time/rate"
    "google.golang.org/grpc"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
    "context"
)

func RateLimitInterceptor(limiter *rate.Limiter) grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor {
    return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (interface{}, error) {
        if !limiter.Allow() {
            return nil, status.Errorf(codes.ResourceExhausted, "rate limit exceeded")
        }
        return handler(ctx, req)
    }
}

// Usage in server setup
limiter := rate.NewLimiter(rate.Limit(100), 200) // 100 requests per second, burst of 200
server := grpc.NewServer(
    grpc.UnaryInterceptor(RateLimitInterceptor(limiter)),
)
```

## 9.2 Quota Management

Quotas are limits on the total amount of resources a client can consume over a longer period, such as daily or monthly limits. They ensure fair distribution of resources among clients and help in capacity planning.

Key aspects of quota management in the Federation API:

- **Provider-Defined Quotas**: Each Provider defines and enforces their own quotas based on their business model and available resources.

- **Resource-Specific Quotas**: Quotas can be applied to various resources, such as the number of active services, total bandwidth usage, or cumulative connection time.

- **Quota Tracking**: Providers must implement systems to track quota usage across multiple requests and over time.

Example of a simple quota tracking system in Go:

```go
import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

type QuotaManager struct {
    mu     sync.Mutex
    quotas map[string]int64
    limits map[string]int64
    reset  time.Time
}

func NewQuotaManager(resetInterval time.Duration) *QuotaManager {
    qm := &QuotaManager{
        quotas: make(map[string]int64),
        limits: make(map[string]int64),
        reset:  time.Now().Add(resetInterval),
    }
    go qm.resetQuotas(resetInterval)
    return qm
}

func (qm *QuotaManager) resetQuotas(interval time.Duration) {
    for {
        time.Sleep(interval)
        qm.mu.Lock()
        qm.quotas = make(map[string]int64)
        qm.reset = time.Now().Add(interval)
        qm.mu.Unlock()
    }
}

func (qm *QuotaManager) ConsumeQuota(clientID string, amount int64) bool {
    qm.mu.Lock()
    defer qm.mu.Unlock()

    if qm.quotas[clientID]+amount > qm.limits[clientID] {
        return false
    }
    qm.quotas[clientID] += amount
    return true
}

// Usage in a gRPC method
func (s *server) ScheduleService(ctx context.Context, req *pb.ScheduleServiceRequest) (*pb.ScheduleServiceResponse, error) {
    clientID := getClientIDFromContext(ctx)
    if !s.quotaManager.ConsumeQuota(clientID, 1) {
        return nil, status.Errorf(codes.ResourceExhausted, "service quota exceeded")
    }
    // Proceed with scheduling the service
}
```

## 9.3 Backoff Strategies

When clients encounter rate limiting or quota exhaustion, they should implement appropriate backoff strategies to avoid overwhelming the server with retry attempts.

Providers can assist clients by including retry information in their error responses:

```go
import (
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
    "google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc/errdetails"
    "time"
)

func (s *server) ScheduleService(ctx context.Context, req *pb.ScheduleServiceRequest) (*pb.ScheduleServiceResponse, error) {
    if rateExceeded() {
        st := status.New(codes.ResourceExhausted, "Rate limit exceeded")
        retryInfo := &errdetails.RetryInfo{
            RetryDelay: durationpb.New(5 * time.Second),
        }
        st, _ = st.WithDetails(retryInfo)
        return nil, st.Err()
    }
    // Proceed with scheduling the service
}
```

Clients can then extract this information and adjust their retry behavior accordingly:

```go
st, ok := status.FromError(err)
if ok && st.Code() == codes.ResourceExhausted {
    for _, detail := range st.Details() {
        if retryInfo, ok := detail.(*errdetails.RetryInfo); ok {
            retryDelay := retryInfo.RetryDelay.AsDuration()
            // Wait for the suggested delay before retrying
            time.Sleep(retryDelay)
            break
        }
    }
}
```

By implementing robust rate limiting and quota management systems, Providers can ensure the stability and fairness of their Federation API services. Clients, in turn, should be prepared to handle rate limiting and quota errors gracefully, implementing appropriate backoff strategies to maintain good citizenship within the federated network ecosystem.

Remember that while these examples provide a starting point, real-world implementations may need to be more sophisticated, taking into account factors such as distributed systems, persistent storage for quota tracking, and more complex rate limiting algorithms tailored to the specific needs of the Provider's infrastructure and business model.

# 10. Versioning

Versioning is a critical aspect of API design and management, especially for a complex and evolving system like the Federation API. Proper versioning ensures that changes to the API can be introduced without breaking existing client implementations, while also allowing for the deprecation of outdated features. This section covers the API versioning scheme, backwards compatibility considerations, and the deprecation policy.

## 10.1 API Versioning Scheme

The Federation API follows semantic versioning principles, which provide a clear and standardized way to communicate the nature of changes in each release.

The version number is structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

- MAJOR version increments indicate incompatible API changes
- MINOR version increments add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- PATCH version increments make backwards-compatible bug fixes

Key aspects of the Federation API versioning scheme:

1. **Version in Package Name**: The API version is included in the package name of the Protocol Buffer definitions. For example:

   ```protobuf
   package aalyria.spacetime.api.fed.v1alpha;
   ```

   This approach allows multiple versions of the API to coexist in the same codebase.

2. **Alpha and Beta Designations**: Early versions of the API may be designated as alpha (v1alpha, v1alpha2, etc.) or beta (v1beta, v1beta2, etc.) to indicate that they are still evolving and may undergo significant changes.

3. **Version in Method Names**: For significant changes that can't be accommodated within the existing structure, new methods may be introduced with version suffixes:

   ```protobuf
   rpc ScheduleServiceV2(ScheduleServiceV2Request) returns (ScheduleServiceV2Response) {}
   ```

4. **Client Libraries**: Official client libraries should follow the same versioning scheme as the API itself.

## 10.2 Backwards Compatibility

Maintaining backwards compatibility is a key principle in the evolution of the Federation API. This ensures that existing client implementations continue to function as the API evolves.

Guidelines for maintaining backwards compatibility:

1. **Adding Fields**: New fields can be added to existing messages without breaking compatibility. Clients using an older version of the API will simply ignore these new fields.

   ```protobuf
   message ExistingMessage {
     string existing_field = 1;
     // New field added in a backwards-compatible way
     optional string new_field = 2;
   }
   ```

2. **Deprecating Fields**: Instead of removing fields, they should be marked as deprecated:

   ```protobuf
   message ExistingMessage {
     string existing_field = 1;
     // Deprecated field
     string old_field = 2 [deprecated = true];
   }
   ```

3. **Enum Values**: New enum values can be added, but existing values should not be removed or have their numeric values changed.

4. **Method Signatures**: Existing method signatures should not be changed. For significant changes, new methods should be introduced (potentially with version suffixes) rather than modifying existing ones.

5. **Default Values**: Changing default values can be backwards-incompatible and should be avoided. Instead, new fields with new defaults can be introduced.

Example of evolving an API method in a backwards-compatible way:

```protobuf
// Original method
rpc ScheduleService(ScheduleServiceRequest) returns (ScheduleServiceResponse) {}

// New method with additional functionality
rpc ScheduleServiceV2(ScheduleServiceV2Request) returns (ScheduleServiceV2Response) {}

message ScheduleServiceV2Request {
  ScheduleServiceRequest original_request = 1;
  // Additional fields for new functionality
  optional AdditionalParameters additional_params = 2;
}
```

## 10.3 Deprecation Policy

A clear deprecation policy helps API consumers plan for and adapt to changes in the API over time. The Federation API follows these deprecation guidelines:

1. **Announcement**: Deprecations are announced well in advance, typically at least 6 months before the deprecated feature is removed or significantly changed.

2. **Documentation**: Deprecated features are clearly marked in the API documentation, including the version in which they were deprecated and the suggested alternative.

3. **Code Annotations**: Deprecated elements in the Protocol Buffer definitions are marked with the `deprecated` option:

   ```protobuf
   message OldMessage {
     option deprecated = true;
     // Message contents
   }

   rpc OldMethod(OldRequest) returns (OldResponse) {
     option deprecated = true;
   }
   ```

4. **Staged Deprecation**: For critical or widely-used features, a staged deprecation process may be used:
   - Stage 1: Feature is marked as deprecated, but continues to function normally.
   - Stage 2: Usage of the deprecated feature triggers warning logs.
   - Stage 3: The deprecated feature is removed or replaced.

5. **Migration Guide**: For significant deprecations, a migration guide is provided to help users transition to the new recommended approach.

6. **Grace Period**: After a feature is officially deprecated, it remains functional for a specified grace period (typically 6-12 months) before being removed.

Example deprecation notice in API documentation:

```
Deprecated: The `OldMethod` RPC will be removed in v2.0.0. Please use `NewMethod` instead.
This method was deprecated in v1.5.0 and will be removed after a 6-month grace period.

Migration guide: [link to migration guide]
```

By following these versioning, backwards compatibility, and deprecation practices, the Federation API can evolve to meet new requirements and incorporate improvements while minimizing disruption to existing users. API consumers should regularly review release notes and deprecation notices to stay informed about changes and plan for migrations when necessary.
